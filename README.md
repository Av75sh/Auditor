# 🎧 Project: CleanAudio – Audio Editing Landing Page

## 📌 Overview

This project is a **modern, responsive landing page** for an audio editing tool called **CleanAudio**. The site introduces key features like audio noise removal, waveform editing, effects, and format support. It is visually optimized for creators, podcasters, and audio engineers.

The page uses **scroll-based animations**, a clean layout, and is built entirely with frontend tools — no backend integration required.

## 💡 Project Description

- **React JS (JSX only)** – Component-based UI
- **Vanilla CSS** – Organized styles via `styles/` folder
- **Framer Motion** – For scroll-based transitions and interactive animations
